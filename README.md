# Story

Windmillsoft team has been carrying out lots of consulting and customizing projects since starting Salesforce.com consulting business in 2017.

Also in these projects, we were able to discover repeated patterns and requirements for features that many customers needed to customize. \
Therefore, our team avoided developing functions repeatedly for each project according to customer requirements, and standardized repeated patterns and requirements.

In addition, based on this, our vision was to create tools that enable Salesforce admins to quickly expand Salesforce on their own without the help of developers.&#x20;

After a lot of challenges, our vision is being realized through the development of the following two product lines.
